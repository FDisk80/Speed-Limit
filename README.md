**To Install on Your Phone:** Open Chrome on your Android phone and navigate to: https://fdisk80.github.io/Speed-Limit

Chrome should automatically detect that this is an installable PWA. Tap the three-dot menu icon in the top right.
You should see an option that says "Install app" or "Add to Home screen". Tap it.
Confirm the installation.

The screen will not go to sleep as long as the page is opened.

**Note:** If you have you have a thin gray line at the top, this is a Chrome behaviour. To resolve this move the Chrime addredd bar to the bottom. Or open the link in Firefox instead and use the "Add to Home screen" feature to quickly open it as an app without the address bar.

**Fallback system:** First, it will try to find the exact, posted speed limit for your location.
If it can't find one, it will perform a second search to determine the type of road you are on (e.g., motorway, residential street).
It will then display an estimated speed limit based on that road type as an advisory speed.
